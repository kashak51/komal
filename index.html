        <p>Hello I am Komal visual artists from vadodara,Gujarat,india. Currently working from vadodara. I engage my practice in multimedia, exploring and Experimenting which take my process to installation, sculpting, photography and painting.</p>
        <p>My body of work uses altered and/or constructed imagery assisted with found objects that resonate the grey areas of social structure, self identity and space. I primarily relate with the identities of a woman in a domestic space where she constantly struggles to alter her personalities according to her responsibilities, excluding her right to a personal space in that tiring process. Thus as an exposition of my own mind, I create boxes or enclosed spaces of deconstructed photographs and objects from my memory where one can interact through the doors provided. The camera provides me with a perspective or the lens or a selective point of view to portray fragments that best renders my personal crisis with existence and identity. The photograph gives an illusion of that challenging existence in the exterior and the interior creating a punctum.</p>
        <p>The search started with an intention to search for a pseudo space that otherwise was not attainable physically. Experimenting with enclosure and the idea of creating a private space led to the formation of boxes and use of archival materials as a repository of memories. It is a manifestation of the personal into the public sphere through the conscious alteration of photographic images and construction of enclosed space. My body of work provides an imagery of the otherwise unknown or overlooked emotion and identity of a woman through her memories. It has now gradually grown into an endeavour for developing visuals to show a collective consciousness of the female entity independent of her relation to her responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The manifestation of the mentioned concepts takes an immense amount of psychological effort as it is difficult to portray the private and the personal onto a public sphere.  The photographs that I take or the subjects that I chose to portray in them adhere to my personal sphere – mostly members of my own family and it is a constant struggle to open them up to a public viewership. But for me it is an archive of my psyche, of my unattended identity and an unattained space – all of which are constantly overlooked and in dire need of an aperture.</p>
        <p>Currently I am building up enclosed spaces using easily available material and digital photographs with intervention and alteration with ink and charcoal. They are at present in a nascent intuitive stage forming a cluster of space, memory, emotion and identity. In the future I would like to develop it into a more sorted and concise pattern of work which will better convey my inner psyche to the viewers in a better way. The grant will be helpful for the development of the project in multiple ways – it will provide me with better material and tools for smarter and precise execution along with a chance to experiment more with the notions and methods of constructed photography and its multiple ways of printing that might suit my visuals in a more adept way.</p>
